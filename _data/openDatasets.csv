Classification of Boundaries of an RGBD Image,https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/research/projects/cvit-projects/semantic-classification-of-boundaries-of-an-rgbd-image,IIITH,We use both image and depth cues to infer the labels of edge pixels. We start with a set of edge pixels obtained from an edge detection algorithm and the goal is to assign one of the four labels to each of these edge pixels. Each edge pixel is uniquely mapped to one of the contour segments. Contour segments are sets of linked edge pixels.
