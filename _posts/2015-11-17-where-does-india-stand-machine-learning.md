_We lag…Indian academia does less machine learning papers than a single
university in China and all the new companies do lesser than a single company
in the USA._

###The power of machine learning
Machine learning is the science of _learning_ to do tasks by observing
examples. It is transforming the world by enabling machines do all sorts of
‘intelligent’ tasks such as understanding images, human speech, predicting
preferences, diseases and many others. With tremendous amount of data, interconnectedness,
sophisticated algorithms and huge processing power in small devices, machines
do things which were beyond their reach until recently. On the other hand, machines are still unable
to do many tasks which humans do effortlessly, say understanding a story – this
constitutes the next big challenge for machines, well, the humans that build
these machines! There is a renewed, although periodic, fear that machines will
put people out of jobs- leaving only the very highly skilled in the job marketplace. [[1](#_ftn1)] For
the first time, some experts in AI/ML _whisper_ fears of machines
challenging the human civilization [[2](#_ftn2)]!

Whatever the future may hold, machine learning has created efficiencies in
the marketplace, leading to new hugely successful business models. The use of
recommender systems [[3](#_ftn3)] is
just one powerful example, others being in tagging images/videos [[4](#_ftn4)]
and those in education technology such as automatic grading/feedback [[5](#_ftn5)]
on tests. There has been a sudden spur in better performing machine learning
techniques, viz. deep learning. Current businesses rely more and more on data
and the predictive power associated with building predictive models. All
successful digital product/services companies have a machine learning or a data
sciences team and hang around in machine learning conferences. This includes
the surprising visit of Mr. Zuckerberg in NIPS a couple of years back. Together
with this, new machine learning techniques coupled with advances in
neurosciences is helping us understand the probable basis and mechanism of
intelligence better. These techniques have made a substantial business impact
and there is today hope to better understand _intelligence_.

### Machine learning a wholesome opportunity for India: Satisfies 6 important criteria
In some way, it has never been so exciting! Where should India be, as
machines are becoming more intelligent? It is simple – it should be making the
most of the opportunity. We need to participate and contribute in high quality
research, innovation and also convert new results into effective business
models.  The opportunity is global – the
location of a digital business doesn’t constrain its market [[6](#_ftn6)]
– a company in a Bangalore or a Gurgaon could serve the US market, the Europe market or even the whole
world. Notwithstanding, there are number of local problems which machine learning can
solve effectively. For instance, it can help find the poverty landscape in the
country in a cheap way [[7](#_ftn7)] and whether interventions to such findings made
a difference over time. Machine learning is not just a scientific or an
academic pursuit. **The economy and society can get great returns by the research
and innovation in the area.**

India needs to work with the world as an equal partner to lead the next
generation of innovation in machine learning. This has the potential to change the world,
once again.
**The good news is that it doesn’t require expensive infrastructure – a person
with just a laptop and say MATLAB can write 1000 (or lesser) lines of code
which can revolutionize how things are done.** [[8](#_ftn8)]
The fundamental skills required are those in math and coding, in which Indians
do have an enviable past record. These need to be combined with tons of creativity, passion and a system’s
approach to things.

To sum up, machine learning is one
of the few fields which fulfill the following six criteria: 

 1. It has potential to lead several
disruptive innovations in the coming decade; 
 2. It has huge impact to businesses
and the economy 
 3. It can help provide _necessary_
elements to solve local problems including those in poverty and social
development
 4. It has potential to lead to new
scientific results not known to humanity before
 5. It does not require expensive
infrastructure and has moderate to low gestation period;
 6. The primary skills it need are
already in the DNA and culture of India, may I, for the last 2000 years. 

What is more- it is cool, young and fashionable!

### We need to grab this opportunity! But, where are we today?
Before I delve into it objectively, let me mull over a sort of strange historic
connection India has had with machine learning. The way of science in India was
inductive and empirical – say calculations of which stars and planets will show
up when or how to find roots of a certain equations. For many of these, we did
not have a proof or any formalism around it [[9](#_ftn9)].
In contrast, the West brought in formal knowledge based methods and theories to
_explain, prove_ and _generalize_ the empirical [[10](#_ftn10)].
These were much more effective and reduced interest in the magical inductive
results. **Today, we find for a lot of more complex problems, these empirical
methods do much better than the formal ones – that is the learning in AI from
the last couple of decades. We have come a full circle.**

But India is lacking… Let us start by looking at academic research. We do find
pockets of excellence. **There is some critical mass of machine learning
researchers in IISc.** They can collaborate to tackle hard and interesting
problems and publish world class results. Also, in some of the IITs, such as
IIT Delhi, we find some people in machine learning including those who have
returned with a foreign education. **IKDD CODS [[11](#_ftn11)],
a conference in data science with world class standards, started in India in 2013.**

Objectively, we looked at the total papers in the top 13 machine learning
conferences in the last 15 years (see figure 1). **All put together, India
produces lesser papers than a single world class university in China – the Tshingua university. We
do one-third of Carnegie Mellon University of USA. Our total research papers
have been 745, China is 3956 and USA is 19,000+.** We rank 15th by the number of
documents we produce, with a Singapore, a Spain, an Israel and a Canada bettering
us (see figure 2). We have a lot to catch up and only a disruptive mission
based approach can make this happen.

</figure>



**Let us look at industrial research,** where the picture is even starker. China
produces 10x more papers, with Singapore being twice and US being 50 times
ahead. New companies [[12](#_ftn12)]
are the engine of growth and have the potential to create disruption and maximum
business value. **In India, we could only find 12 papers from 5 startups in the
last 15 years!** One of it is Aspiring Minds - our work on programming assessment
and spoken English assessment at KDD. Another notable is Strand Life Sciences,
with some high quality work in Bioinformatics, Infibeam in e-commerce and S&I
Engineering pushing the frontiers in computer vision. Both Strand and SI are
companies that came out of IISc and are great examples to emulate. **Compare this
to USA or China: a Linkedin has 17, Facebook 15, a Baidu 22, Alibaba 4,
Tencents 3, Renren 2 followed by a long tail of companies.** No wonder MIT
Technology Review’s top 50 smartest companies have 7 out of the top 10 from US,
3 from China and none from India! One may note that much of the **open source
software and libraries for storing, handling, searching and analyzing big data
has come from new companies and not universities.** The same is true for recommender
systems to an extent [[13](#_ftn13)].

Startups need to invest in research specifically in the area of machine
learning. They need to follow the examples of (and even outperform)
a Facebook, a Baidu, a Tencents and an Aspiring Minds. **These companies have separate data
science research groups. This will let them have a sustainable business edge,
be disruptive and globally competitive.** Otherwise, they we will be ripped off,
once again [[14](#_ftn14)], by
new innovations happening in other parts of the world. The speed of innovation
and disruption is much faster now – we need to keep running to be at the same pace!

### So what do we need to do? Probably a lot… 
To make a small beginning, my colleagues and [I]() at Aspiring Minds, put together ‘ML India’ – a place for the machine learning
community in India to interact, share, develop ideas, continuously assess
itself and achieve new heights. No surprises, we take a data visualization [[15](#_ftn15)]
approach to it! If you do machine learning in India, do let us know and we will
highlight you on ml-india.org. If you have something interesting, share on the [ml-india@googlegroups.com](mailto:ml-india@googlegroups.com){:target="_blank"}
mail-list. This is just a beginning – ml-india.org will do a lot more for the
community, both through online and offline media. Keep watching!

Wait for another post on what we can do to super accelerate our machine
learning efforts. Till then check out how, for the first time in the world, we
are teaching 12-15 year old kids in India supervised learning [[16](#_ftn16)]!

Well, it could require computer clusters and farms. However, a ton of
innovation doesn’t require it. Also, such resources are easy to ‘summon’ these
days, say using amazon servers.

Strangely we did have the best of formal methods in metaphysics, but not as
much in physical sciences!

I am reminded of Minsky – Occam’s razor is a bad idea to understand
intelligence – unfortunately intelligence isn’t simple to understand.
