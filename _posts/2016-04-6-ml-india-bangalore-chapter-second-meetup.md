ML-India is pleased to inform that the second
ML-India meetup in its Bangalore chapter was held last Saturday (2nd April).

This time around, the meetup hosted by Sritulasi had around 20 participants and the group discussed ranking of pairwise data and set the agenda to discuss and solve problems on Kaggle. 
They had a guest speaker from Xerox Research, Dr. Arun Rajkumar, who talked about [Borda](https://www.math.ku.edu/~jmartin/courses/math105-F11/Lectures/chapter1-part2.pdf){:target="_blank"},
and [Kwick](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/papers/kwik.pdf){:target="_blank"}, algorithms for pair wise ranking and a variation of Borda which Arun has worked on. 
He showed how it can work on sparse data and achieve similar results as a regular Borda algorithm. The audience thoroughly enjoyed this interactive session.

Following this, they had a discussion on Kaggle problems which was very productive and suggestions to organize a workshop on solving these problems via coding came up. 

The participation, response and feedback from the participants was very encouraging! Weâ€™ll keep up with having bigger and engaging meetups on ML, and having researchers and practitioners
involved in ML to discuss their work and insights. Looking forward to future meetups.
Spread the word to yourself/your friends from Bangalore enroll for the meetups.
