ML-India is pleased to inform that the fourth ML-India meetup in its Bangalore chapter was held on 28 May 2016.

The discussion revolved around basics of [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)s, [RNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)s and [Multimodal Deep Learning](http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml11-MultimodalDeepLearning.pdf). They had a speaker - [Arijit Biswas](https://in.linkedin.com/in/arijit-biswas-46690236), research scientist at Xerox Research Centre India (XRCI). He gave a very comprehensive talk on the motivation behind Deep Learning. He took them through the basics of Neural Network and how does it work. Then they dived into Convolution Neural Network (CNN) which he suggested is focused mainly towards image recognition. They also discussed a case study on that. For video processing, where sequencing is important, he recommended the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and explained how [LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) networks work. Finally, he presented one of things he is currently working on - Multimodal Deep Learning at Xerox.

The slide deck presented by Arijit can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5e-wnFrLgTETktvdERDdlNtWEk&usp=sharing).

The response and feedback from the participants were very encouraging! They had around 25 people participating in the meetup this time. The participants were very active and some of them who are using these concepts in their corporate projects had a lot of questions. They were very thankful to the organizer for taking these topics up and were keen on attending such meetups in the future.

We’ll keep up with having such engaging meetups on ML, and having researchers and practitioners involved in ML to discuss their work and insights. Looking forward to future meetups. Spread the word to your friends from Bangalore to enroll for the meetups.
