We are pleased to inform that the eleventh ML-India meetup in its Bangalore chapter was held on 9th April 2017.

In this meetup, they had a two guest speakers. [Mr. Hari Shankar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hari-shankar-86860547/){:target="_blank"}, a Product Manager at "Security Intelligence as a Service" Team at Wipro, gave a talk about his projects on using ML algorithms in detecting advanced persistent threats and also present a framework on how these algorithms are being put in use, in real-world scenarios. He has over 12 years of experience in designing & implementing Enterprise Security solutions.  His current academic pursuit focuses on statistical analysis (Machine Learning, Analytics, R programming) of security data for detection, diagnostic, forensic and predictive purposes. After this, [Mr. Paranth Thiruvengadam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paranth-thiruvengadam-2567719/){:target="_blank"}, a Senior Director of Engineering at Walmart Labs with a proven track record of designing highly scalable platforms, gave a talk explaining the process of taking a machine learning model from 'Development' to 'Production'.

The participants were delighted to be a part of the meetup. They had the biggest audience this time - 70 people participated. The talks were very informative and engaging. 

Shoutout to Walmart Labs, they did a great job in hosting us. We’ll keep up with having such engaging meetups on ML, and having researchers and practitioners involved in ML to discuss their work and insights. Looking forward to future meetups. Spread the word to your friends from Bangalore to enroll for the meetups.
