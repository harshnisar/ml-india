### How Machine Learning is being Used
The biological samples are first converted into a large giga pixel sized image. These images are then pre-processed and fed into our Neural Network (DeepCerv) that has been built for classifying the sample into various stage of cervical cancer manifestation.
The output from the NN, is then sent to a pathologist for confirmation. The results of this confirmation are then used to re-train the model at regular intervals. 
The newly trained models are then sent back to the end point computing units.

### ML Conferences and Contributions
* MICCAI 
* BMVC

## Machine Learning Patents
* Patents are in National Phase application. Details will be provided on request.

### Key Innovations and Research Contributions
Our AI platform Astra, is built to detect critical illnesses such as Cancer. Astra is a powerful platform that can be extended to build detection tools for a number of critical illnesses.
As the first beachhead, we have developed a point-of-care detection system for Cervical Cancer that is quick, affordable and accessible. CervAstra will enable women to walk-in to their nearest primary health center, get screened and walk out with their reports. It is that simple.
Our intelligent screening system CervAstra, tailwinds the development and striking benefits of computational pathology.
