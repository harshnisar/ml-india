title: "Hyper Verge"
excerpt: "Our story began in 2009 at IIT Madras. We started out as a student team that was struggling to install a vision library in Ubuntu. With the support of the ecosystem at IIT Madras we represented IIT Madras and India in various robotics competitions around the world.

As a student team, we also took up challenging consulting assignments to get hands-on knowledge about solving real-life problems. We built prototypes for the inspection of overhead lines for railways, inspection of biscuits, inspection of raw rubber, identification of grain boundaries, classification of weld defects and auto-enhancement of images.

After internships at Microsoft, Qualcomm, Schlumberger and NetApp, we knew that the time had come to start HyperVerge."
