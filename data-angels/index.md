In the list of the world’s 50 [smartest companies](https://www.technologyreview.com/lists/companies/2016/){:target="_blank"} by MIT Technology review, there are 5 from China, 3 from Japan, 2 from Israel, 6 from Europe and one each from South Korea and Nigeria and the rest from United States. India draws a blank. There is hardly any company from India with worldwide respect for its innovative product or technology. On similar lines, in an earlier [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/where-does-india-stand-machines-become-intelligent-varun-aggarwal?trk=mp-author-card){:target="_blank"} we noted India’s dismal record in machine learning research - Tsinghua University in Beijing alone does more machine learning papers in top conferences every year as compared to the whole of India.

To address this, we are happy to launch <b>Data Angels</b> – angel investors and advisors for the most innovative machine learning led companies from India. These angels have expertise in machine learning and/or experience in building successful technology companies.  (Read more [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-angels-building-worlds-smartest-companies-india-varun-aggarwal?trk=mp-reader-card){:target="_blank"}.)
